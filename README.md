## Team Project Manager 
While attempting this project, my goal was to implement Classes and inheritance in order to create a Command Line Application that will allow me to create a team, set roles, and view them on an HTML Page

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I was able to use Class constructors and create test cases for each one. This deepened my knowledge further on how to traverse multiple files with module exports. One big learning point of this project was running into a recursive function that set me back on my work. After refactoring the algorithms, I am happy to share that I have been able to make the app work. Please see the demo to see how the app functions.
