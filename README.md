## Team Project Manager 
While attempting this project, my goal was to implement Classes and inheritance in order to create a Command Line Application that will allow me to create a team, set roles, and view them on an HTML Page

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I was also able to implement classes and constructors. Though currently, the app is not fully functional. While I am able to create objects that inherit the class of it's parent object, some of the methods still aren't being called on correctly. 

Additionally, the app is not currenltly producing an HTML file to which the team members are appended to.
